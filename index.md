# Please Do Your Research before Chatting!

## TL;DR

Modern chat communication should be done in a way that saves time for all
participants and enables an efficient, asynchronous exchange of information.
**Don't expect an answer to questions that are clearly documented**. Instead, spend at
least 10min to find the answer to your question yourself before asking. It is a way
of showing that you respect the time of the other person.

## Chat Etiquette

When you are faced with a problem, start by looking at the minimal viable action that you can take yourself first.
The minimal viable action defines the steps you can do yourself and cost you minimal energy, before you waste time for some of your co-workers.

So don't do this:

<pre>
2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi, how can I [...]
# CO-WORKER SWITCHES HIS CONTEXT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION
2010-07-19 12:32:15 co-worker: Have you tried the steps from the documentation here [...]
# 10 MINS LATER
2010-07-19 12:42:01 you: I have looked through the documentation, but actually my problem is [...]
# CO-WORKER SWITCHES HIS CONTEXT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AGAIN
2010-07-19 12:44:21 co-worker: Oh, have you searched if there is a similar problem on StackOverflow?
2010-07-19 12:42:01 you: Let me check [...]
# 10 MINS LATER
2010-07-19 12:52:01 you: No, it is not applicable, I want to do [...]
2010-07-19 12:54:21 co-worker: Ah, yeah the answer for that is [...]
</pre>

This costs a lot of time of on both the end of your co-worker and yourself.
Your co-worker has to switch out of his current task multiple times, costing a lot of mental energy.
You have to wait for the answer multiple times, costing you more time in the end as well.

Instead make sure you did the following things first:

* Checked official documentation
* Searched on the intranet (e.g. Sharepoint/Teams)
* Checked Stackoverflow

You should also have a clear understanding of what problem you are trying to solve and
Try describing the entire question to you first, to make sure you have a full understanding of it.
(You would be surprised how often that alone allows you to answer your own question).

<pre>
2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi I have am working on [...] and wanted to do [...]. The steps in the documentation [...] are not applicable. I found this item on stack overflow here [...], but my scenario is different because of [...]. Do you know how to solve it?
2010-07-19 12:33:32 co-worker: [answers question]
</pre>

This way, you minimize the context switches your co-worker has to do, keeping them more productive and show appreciation of their time by doing your own research first.
